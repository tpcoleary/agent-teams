        mid-turn contributes its partial turn up to this moment — plus a team
        ledger (states, open delegations with ages, human blocks).

        Daemon-side and automatic — the supervisor never calls a tool to fetch;
        the sweep arrives as a queued task, like any peer message. Replaces the
        retired token-threshold reviews, which were volume-gated, single-peer,
        and silence-blind (an idle agent owing work never generated tokens, so
        it was never reviewed). Interval: per-agent `supervisor_interval_minutes`
        over SUPERVISOR_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MINUTES. If the supervisor is busy when
        the interval elapses, the sweep fires on the next idle tick and the
        window simply covers the longer span — watermarks keep it gapless.

        IDLE-SKIP: when no watched peer logged a single message this window,
        the sweep is skipped (a cheap per-peer COUNT instead of a measured
        ~85k-token all-IDLE LLM turn) — but never silence-blind: every
        SUPERVISOR_SWEEP_MAX_IDLE_SKIPS-th consecutive idle interval forces a
        full review (the idle-but-OWING guarantee this sweep design exists
        for), and an open delegation older than
        SUPERVISOR_SWEEP_FORCE_OPEN_AGE_SECONDS forces one early, rate-limited
        to once per age window. Skips never advance watermarks, so the next
        real sweep covers the whole quiet span.
