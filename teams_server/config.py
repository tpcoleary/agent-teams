# sweep interval the daemon assembles EVERYTHING each linked peer did since the
# previous sweep — straight from the live monitoring DB, so an agent mid-turn
# contributes its partial turn up to that moment — into ONE task in the
# supervisor's own queue: a section per peer (silent peers get an explicit
# "no activity" section) plus a ledger of states, open delegations with ages,
# and pending human questions. The supervisor then runs a normal turn and
# steers with send_peer_message / pause_agent. There is NO tool to call — the
# sweep is delivered automatically, exactly like any queued message.
#
# Interval: per-agent `supervisor_interval_minutes` (agent settings), else
# this default. The old token-threshold trigger (one peer at a time once it
# accrued a set number of new tokens) is RETIRED — it was volume-gated,

# never generated tokens, so it was never reviewed.

# the very failure the sweep design exists to catch is an idle agent OWING
# work — so every MAX_IDLE_SKIPS-th consecutive idle interval forces a full
