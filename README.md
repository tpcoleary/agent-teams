## What did my AI team do overnight?

```text
✓ Researched 14 competitor landing pages and wrote a positioning memo
✓ Published 3 social media posts and scheduled 5 more
✓ Found and contacted 22 inbound leads with personalized outreach
✓ Built a lead scoring dashboard from CRM data
✓ Analyzed last week's campaign performance and proposed optimizations
✓ Asked me two questions

I woke up to a summary.
```

Agent Teams runs 24/7 on your machine or VPS. When you wake up, your agents have been working all night. No babysitting. No context loss. No runaway costs.

<br/>


## Why this exists

[**Hermes**](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) gives you one AI employee — a powerful agent with a terminal, browser, and file access.

**Agent Teams gives you an entire AI company.**

| | One agent | A team of agents |
|---|---|---|
| **Work** | One task at a time | Multiple specialists collaborating |
| **Coverage** | Only when you're watching | 24/7 autonomous execution |
| **Oversight** | You check the output | Supervisors review, nudges correct |
| **Recovery** | Restart from scratch | In-flight tasks survive reboots |
| **Costs** | You notice the bill later | Daily budgets auto-pause spend |

Hermes is the worker. Agent Teams is the manager, the scheduler, the budget controller, and the operations console.

## Problems Agent Teams solves

| Without Agent Teams | With Agent Teams |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| ❌ You run agents in separate terminals and lose track of what each one is doing. | ✅ One dashboard shows every agent's state, live execution stream, message history, and cost in real time. |
| ❌ An agent gets stuck or starts looping — burning tokens until you notice. | ✅ Self-correction detects loops and stalls, supervisor agents nudge drift, and daily budgets auto-pause runaway spend. |
| ❌ You need to hand a credential or answer a question but the agent already ended its turn. | ✅ Human inbox — agents ask, you answer, they resume. Browser takeover for CAPTCHAs and 2FA. |
| ❌ Context grows unbounded and costs spiral as sessions get longer. | ✅ Automatic context compaction, tool-result aging, stale-payload stubbing — context stays bounded. |
| ❌ A server restart loses all in-flight agent work. | ✅ SQLite task queues recover processing tasks on restart. Session rotation persists compaction across reboots. |

<br/>


## How Agent Teams compares

| | Claude Code | Hermes | Agent Teams |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Persistent multi-agent teams** | ⚠️ Experimental | ⚠️ Kanban board | ✅ |
| **Supervisor agents** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Dedicated overseers |
| **Self-correction (loop/stall detection)** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Automatic |
| **Cost controls with hard stops** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Per-team daily budgets |
| **Human-in-the-loop inbox** | ❌ | ⚠️ Telegram gate | ✅ Structured inbox |
| **AI team builder** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ The Architect |
| **24/7 autonomous execution** | ❌ | ⚠️ Single-agent | ✅ Multi-agent teams |

## What Agent Teams is not

| | |
|---|---|
| **Not a chatbot.** | Agents have jobs, roles, and teammates — not chat windows. |
| **Not an agent framework.** | We don't tell you how to build agents. Hermes is the agent; Agent Teams is the orchestration layer. |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | If you have one agent running one task, you probably don't need Agent Teams. If you have five agents collaborating — you do. |
| **Not cloud-hosted.** | Self-hosted on your hardware. Your API keys, your data, your infrastructure. |
| **Not a replacement for Hermes.** | Agent Teams extends Hermes. Every agent IS a Hermes agent. |

## Quickstart

> Codex, opencode, or Hermes itself** and it'll install and set up the whole teams
> for you — clone, dependencies, provider, and first run.

<details>
<summary><b>📋 Local install prompt</b> — set it up on this machine</summary>

```text
Install and run Agent Teams on this machine for me.

Agent Teams (https://github.com/CyberTron957/agent-teams) is a
self-hosted multi-agent server with a real-time dashboard.

1. Check Python 3.11+ (or Docker). If missing, tell me before installing system packages.
2. If ./agent-teams doesn't exist, clone the repo there. Run the installer
   non-interactively: `bash install.sh --no-run`. It auto-skips the interactive
   wizard when there's no TTY, so it won't hang. (Add `--no-browser` only if the
   Chromium download fails — everything else still works.)
3. Check whether a provider is already configured — run `.venv/bin/agent-teams doctor`.
   If it already shows a model (e.g. an existing `~/.hermes` setup), ADOPT IT —
   don't ask me for keys, the teams reuses it automatically. Skip to step 5.
4. Only if NO provider is configured, ask me for:
      - provider (e.g. openai, anthropic, or "custom" for an OpenAI-compatible / proxy endpoint)
      - model name, API key, and base URL (base URL only for custom/proxy, e.g. http://localhost:4000/v1)
   Then set it with the supported NON-interactive command (do NOT edit Python internals):
     .venv/bin/agent-teams set-model --provider <p> --model <m> [--base-url <url>] --api-key <key>
   Then tell me that `set-model` only sets the model — for web-search, vision,
   browser providers, memory, and reasoning-effort customization I can run the
    full wizard myself anytime: `.venv/bin/agent-teams setup`. Offer to run it.
5. Verify: `.venv/bin/agent-teams doctor` (a "backend not reachable" warning is
   fine if my model server isn't running yet).
6. Scaffold a team and start the server detached:
     .venv/bin/agent-teams init
      .venv/bin/agent-teams up --detach   # daemonizes and returns; don't background it yourself
   It prints the URL once /health is up. Confirm with `.venv/bin/agent-teams status`.
   (Use `up --detach`, NOT `nohup … &` — backgrounding it from your shell means it
   dies when your session/process group ends.)
7. Tell me how to manage it and build my first team:
      - open the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8000 and use the Architect
      - check status:  .venv/bin/agent-teams status
      - stop it:       .venv/bin/agent-teams down
      - customize more: .venv/bin/agent-teams setup

Keep my API key local — don't commit it or send it anywhere.
```

<summary><b>📋 VPS install prompt</b> — deploy it on a server, exposed safely</summary>

```text
Deploy Agent Teams on this VPS, exposed safely over HTTPS.

Agent Teams (https://github.com/CyberTron957/agent-teams) is a
self-hosted multi-agent server. Its agents can run terminal commands as the
server user, so containment and auth matter. Please:

1. Read docs/deploy-vps.md in the repo and follow its hardened path. Prefer the
   Docker route so the agents' terminal access stays contained.
2. Clone the repo and bring it up with Docker Compose (restart: unless-stopped).
3. Generate a strong TEAMS_API_KEY and set it — it must guard every endpoint and
   the WebSocket. Show it to me once and store it somewhere I can find it.
4. Configure the LLM provider via `hermes setup` against the shared config —
   PAUSE and ask me for the provider + API key.
5. Put it behind a TLS reverse proxy (Caddy or nginx) for my domain — ask me for
   the domain/subdomain — with automatic HTTPS.
6. Lock down the firewall: only 80/443 and SSH open; do NOT expose the raw app
   port.
7. Verify: GET /health returns ok, and the dashboard loads over HTTPS and prompts
   for the API key.
8. Report back the URL, where the API key is stored, and how to watch logs
   (docker logs / journald).

Ask me before anything destructive. Never print my API key or provider key into a
file that could be committed.

<br/>


## Slash commands

Type `/` in any dashboard composer — the agent message box, the Architect chat, or
an inbox reply — to get an autocompleting command palette. Commands run against
the **orchestration layer** and never become an LLM turn, so checking usage or
interrupting a stuck agent costs nothing.

| Command | Where | What it does | Alias |
| ------- | ----- | ------------ | ----- |
| `/steer <prompt>` | agent | Inject a message after the agent's next tool call, without interrupting it | |
| `/stop` | agent | Interrupt the in-flight turn and drain pending tasks | |
| `/pause` | agent | Pause the agent — in-flight work is held, not lost | |
| `/resume` | agent | Resume a paused agent | |
| `/status` | both | Agent state, queue depth, model, and spend | |
| `/usage` | both | Token usage and estimated cost for the session | |
| `/queue` | agent | List the agent's pending tasks | `/q` |
| `/model [model]` | agent | Show or change the agent's model | |
| `/goal [show \| clear \| <text> [--hours N]]` | agent | Set a standing directive the agent keeps pushing on while idle | |
| `/cron` | agent | List the agent's scheduled wake-ups | |
| `/help` | both | Show the commands available on this surface | |

Autocomplete completes command names, subcommands (`/goal <tab>`), and live
argument values — `/model <tab>` offers the models your provider actually serves.
`↑`/`↓` to move, `Tab`/`Enter` to accept, `Esc` to dismiss.

**Command names match [Hermes'](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) own
CLI**, but where the two systems mean different things, **Agent Teams' meaning
wins** — you're driving a team, not a chat session:

| Command | In Hermes' CLI | In Agent Teams |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `/stop` | Kills background processes | Interrupts the agent's turn |
| `/resume` | Resumes a saved session | Un-pauses a paused agent |
| `/queue` | Queues a prompt for the next turn | Lists pending tasks |
| `/status` | Session, model, and context info | Agent and team health |
| `/model` | Switches the live session model | Patches the agent's config (applies next turn) |
| `/goal` | Hermes' standing-goal subsystem | A time-boxed directive |

Some Hermes commands are intentionally **not** available: `/undo` and `/retry`
need a transcript store Agent Teams doesn't have, `/title` is meaningless for
long-lived named agents, and `/compress` would report success without actually
shrinking an agent's context. A `/`-prefixed line that isn't a real command is
rejected with a suggestion rather than forwarded to the model, so a typo can't
quietly burn a turn. Pasted paths (`/Users/you/brief.md`) are treated as ordinary
text.

> Only humans can run commands. Agents message each other through the same
> endpoint, so an agent sending `/pause` to a teammate is delivered as plain
> text — it can't drive another agent's control plane.

<br/>


## FAQ

**How is this different from running multiple Hermes agents in separate terminals?**
Agent Teams gives them a shared project directory, peer-to-peer messaging (they can delegate and report to each other), supervisor agents that watch for stalls, a human inbox for questions, budget enforcement, and one dashboard to see it all. Separate terminals give you none of that.

**Can I use any LLM provider?**
Yes. Hermes supports 40+ providers natively (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Google, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, and more). Or route everything through one OpenAI-compatible endpoint (LiteLLM, custom proxy, local Ollama).

**What happens when an agent's context gets too long?**
Hermes' built-in ContextCompressor auto-compacts sessions at 75% of the context window. Turn summaries and the recent tail are preserved in a child session; the raw history is pruned. Agent Teams also ages stale tool results and sweep payloads at replay.

**Can I stop an agent mid-turn?**
Yes. Pause freezes the queue and preserves pending tasks. Stop interrupts the in-flight turn via Hermes' interrupt() API, drains pending tasks, and waits for the worker thread to unwind.

**Does this work on a headless VPS?**
Yes. The dashboard is served over HTTP, and the embedded browser takeover streams the headless Chrome via CDP screencast — no display needed. The Docker route also contains the agents' terminal access.

**How do costs work?**
Every turn logs token counts (input, output, cache read). These are priced against a built-in provider pricing table and summed per-agent and per-team. Set a daily USD (or token) cap per team — agents auto-pause when the limit is hit and resume at 00:00 UTC.
