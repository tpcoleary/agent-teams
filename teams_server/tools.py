      • no live waiter → the caller must enqueue a resume task (the agent already
        ended its turn, or this is a stale/old question the agent isn't on).

    Because the decision is per-question, answering an OLD question never feeds its
    answer to an agent currently blocked on a DIFFERENT one, and a pause/stop that
    merely sets the event (without answering) leaves status 'pending' so this never
    misreports a wake as an answer.

        the event flag — pause_execution/stop_execution also set human_event to
        break the wait, and that must NOT be mistaken for a human answer.

    On timeout/pause/stop the question is LEFT pending, so a later answer is
